# NoClickBoard

A Kanboard plugin that prevents the browser to redirect to the task-detailview by clicking a task in the boardview  
while keeping the dropdown & quickedit usable

Works in collapsed & expanded mode

Currently you need to a "NoClick" custom role in the project and assign users/groups where the behavior should be applied to that role
